# FoxDot Worksheet

This worksheet is intended to be used by new users who want a quick intro into the various aspects of the FoxDot live coding environment but can also be used / adapted by anyone interested in running a FoxDot workshop themselves. If you do adapt it, please feel free to make a pull request so that others can benefit too. 

This worksheet is *not* and in-depth description of the system and only covers the commonly used features. If you would like to know more about specific functions, please visit [the FoxDot documentation page](http://docs.foxdot.org/), which is still in progress.

To get started with the worksheet, either fork this repository if you feel comfortabe with git or download the project as .zip file. Then just open the `worksheet.py` file in the [FoxDot](https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot) editor and have fun!
